The night of the pre-holiday dance he slipped away and went early to bed for the pleasure of hearing the violin music cross the grass and come surging in at his window.

It was worth while to speak out upon serious matters in an essay; and there was nothing absurd in writing as well as one possibly could when, in a month or two, the same public which had welcomed the essay in a magazine would carefully read it once more in a book.

The Prince lived at St. James\u2019s; but he might come along in the morning to visit his mother.", "She had sighted two sinister grey vessels, low in the water, and bald as bone, one closely following the other with the look of eyeless beasts seeking their prey. Consciousness returned to Richard instantly.", "\u201cWhat!

Through them she looked at the hall which was now laid with great breadths of sunlight, and at the careless, casual groups of people who were standing beside the solid arm-chairs and tables. They looked to her unreal, or as people look who remain unconscious that some great explosion is about to take place beside them. But there was no explosion, and they went on standing by the chairs and the tables. Mrs. Thornbury no longer saw them, but, penetrating through them as though they were without substance, she saw the house, the people in the house, the room, the bed in the room, and the figure of the dead lying still in the dark beneath the sheets.", "\u201cThere it is,\u201d said Rezia, twirling Mrs. Peters\u2019 hat on the tips of her fingers. \u201cThat\u2019ll do for the moment.

Peter Walsh laughed out.", "If then in Sophocles the play is concentrated in the figures themselves, and in Euripides is to be retrieved from flashes of poetry and questions far flung and unanswered, \u00c6schylus makes these little dramas (the Agamemnon has 1663 lines; Lear about 2600), tremendous by stretching every phrase to the utmost, by sending them floating forth in metaphors, by bidding them rise up and stalk eyeless and majestic through the scene. To understand him it is not so necessary to understand Greek as to understand poetry. It is necessary to take that dangerous leap through the air without the support of words which Shakespeare also asks of us. For words, when opposed to such a blast of meaning, must give out, must be blown astray, and only by collecting in companies convey the meaning which each one separately is too weak to express. Connecting them in a rapid flight of the mind we know instantly and instinctively what they mean, but could not decant that meaning afresh into any other words.", "\"There!\" she exclaimed. \"It never struck me to ask. It never occurred to me that they could possibly produce anything.\"", "Here Helen passed them, and seeing Rachel arm-in-arm with a comparative stranger, looking excited, was amused, but at the same time slightly irritated.

Another strange thing about the day was that the luncheon was forgotten by all of them until it was late in the afternoon, and then Mrs. Chailey waited on them, and looked strange too, because she wore a stiff print dress, and her sleeves were rolled up above her elbows. She seemed as oblivious of her appearance, however, as if she had been called out of her bed by a midnight alarm of fire, and she had forgotten, too, her reserve and her composure; she talked to them quite familiarly as if she had nursed them and held them naked on her knee. She assured them over and over again that it was their duty to eat.", "\u201cI\u2019ve got all his pamphlets,\u201d she said. \u201cLittle pamphlets.

Personally I find little to be said for the moderns, but I\u2019m going to send you Wedekind when I\u2019ve done him. Donne? Have you read Webster and all that set? I envy you reading them for the first time.", "He stayed, however, in apparent contentment for six days, playing with a microscope and a notebook in one of the many sparsely furnished sitting-rooms, but on the evening of the seventh day, as they sat at dinner, he appeared more restless than usual. The dinner-table was set between two long windows which were left uncurtained by Helen\u2019s orders. Darkness fell as sharply as a knife in this climate, and the town then sprang out in circles and lines of bright dots beneath them. Buildings which never showed by day showed by night, and the sea flowed right over the land judging by the moving lights of the steamers. The sight fulfilled the same purpose as an orchestra in a London restaurant, and silence had its setting.", "Afterwards he could remember standing by old Miss Parry\u2019s chair in the drawing-room. Clarissa came up, with her perfect manners, like a real hostess, and wanted to introduce him to some one\u2014spoke as if they had never met before, which enraged him. Yet even then he admired her for it.

The solitary traveller is soon beyond the wood; and there, coming to the door with shaded eyes, possibly to look for his return, with hands raised, with white apron blowing, is an elderly woman who seems (so powerful is this infirmity) to seek, over a desert, a lost son; to search for a rider destroyed; to be the figure of the mother whose sons have been killed in the battles of the world. So, as the solitary traveller advances down the village street where the women stand knitting and the men dig in the garden, the evening seems ominous; the figures still; as if some august fate, known to them, awaited without fear, were about to sweep them into complete annihilation.", "\u201cI flit from branch to branch,\u201d continued Hewet. \u201cThe world is profoundly pleasant.\u201d He lay back on the bed, upon his arms.", "An offering for the sake of offering, perhaps. Anyhow, it was her gift. Nothing else had she of the slightest importance; could not think, write, even play the piano. She muddled Armenians and Turks; loved success; hated discomfort; must be liked; talked oceans of nonsense: and to this day, ask her what the Equator was, and she did not know.", "For an old woman of her age she was very restless, and for one of her clear, quick mind she was unusually perplexed. She could not settle to anything, so that she was relieved when the door opened. She went up to her husband, took him in her arms, and kissed him with unusual intensity, and then as they sat down together she began to pat him and question him as if he were a baby, an old, tired, querulous baby. She did not tell him about Miss Vinrace\u2019s death, for that would only disturb him, and he was put out already. She tried to discover why he was uneasy.", "In certain lights that mark on the wall seems actually to project from the wall. Nor is it entirely circular. I cannot be sure, but it seems to cast a perceptible shadow, suggesting that if I ran my finger down that strip of the wall it would, at a certain point, mount and descend a small tumulus, a smooth tumulus like those barrows on the South Downs which are, they say, either tombs or camps. Of the two I should prefer them to be tombs, desiring melancholy like most English people, and finding it natural at the end of a walk to think of the bones stretched beneath the turf.... There must be some book about it.", "\u201cOh, Yarmouth,\u201d said Mrs. Flushing, \u201cjust find my diary and see where ten days from now would bring us to, and ask the hall porter how many men \u2019ud be wanted to row eight people up the river for a week, and what it \u2019ud cost, and put it on a slip of paper and leave it on my dressing-table.

Looking on shore as Mr. Flushing bade her, she thought the country very beautiful, but also sultry and alarming. She did not like to feel herself the victim of unclassified emotions, and certainly as the launch slipped on and on, in the hot morning sun, she felt herself unreasonably moved. Whether the unfamiliarity of the forest was the cause of it, or something less definite, she could not determine. Her mind left the scene and occupied itself with anxieties for Ridley, for her children, for far-off things, such as old age and poverty and death.", "The dusk fell as suddenly as the natives had warned them, the hollows of the mountain on either side filling up with darkness and the path becoming so dim that it was surprising to hear the donkeys\u2019 hooves still striking on hard rock. Silence fell upon one, and then upon another, until they were all silent, their minds spilling out into the deep blue air. The way seemed shorter in the dark than in the day; and soon the lights of the town were seen on the flat far beneath them.", "Can you imagine a very extraordinary cross between Moll Flanders and Lady Ritchie, between a rolling and rollicking woman of the town and a lady of breeding and refinement? Laetitia Pilkington (1712-1759) was something of the sort\u2014shady, shifty, adventurous, and yet, like Thackeray's daughter, like Miss Mitford, like Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 and Jane Austen and Maria Edgeworth, so imbued with the old traditions of her sex that she wrote, as ladies talk, to give pleasure. Throughout her Memoirs, we can never forget that it is her wish to entertain, her unhappy fate to sob. Dabbing her eyes and controlling her anguish, she begs us to forgive an odious breach of manners which only the suffering of a lifetime, the intolerable persecutions of Mr. P\u2014\u2014n, the malignant, she must say the h\u2014\u2014-h, spite of Lady C\u2014\u2014t can excuse.

Oh, it was very queer. Here was So-and-so in South Kensington; some one up in Bayswater; and somebody else, say, in Mayfair. And she felt quite continuously a sense of their existence; and she felt what a waste; and she felt what a pity; and she felt if only they could be brought together; so she did it.", "\u201cOr is it only this damnable engagement?\u201d he continued. \u201cLet\u2019s be married here, before we go back\u2014or is it too great a risk?

But still Sir John delayed; no tomb replaced them. He had his excuses; what with the business of the lawsuit, and his duties at Court, and the disturbance of the civil wars, his time was occupied and his money spent. But perhaps something strange had happened to Sir John himself, and not only to Sir John dallying in London, but to his sister Margery falling in love with the bailiff, and to Walter making Latin verses at Eton, and to John flying his hawks at Paston. Life was a little more various in its pleasures.", "\u201cThere\u2019s Pepper writing to his aunt,\u201d said Hewet. \u201cShe must be a very remarkable old lady, eighty-five he tells me, and he takes her for walking tours in the New Forest. . . .", "\u201cNot a bit of it!\u201d said Mr. Flushing, turning round, for Mr. Pepper took a very long time to consider his move. \u201cIt\u2019s not cowardly to wish to live, Alice.

Think of all the things that are bound to happen!\u201d", "His poetry is first to be considered; of which it must be confessed that it has not often those felicities of diction which give lustre to sentiments, or that vigour of sentiment that animates diction; there is little of ardour, vehemence, or transport; there is very rarely the awfulness of grandeur, and not very often the splendour of elegance. He thinks justly; but he thinks faintly.", "\u201cTell Mr. Pepper,\u201d Rachel bade the servant.

For a moment no one of them could believe that they had really seen live animals in the open\u2014a herd of wild deer, and the sight aroused a childlike excitement in them, dissipating their gloom.", "Voices crying behind them never reached through the waters in which they were now sunk. The repetition of Hewet\u2019s name in short, dissevered syllables was to them the crack of a dry branch or the laughter of a bird. The grasses and breezes sounding and murmuring all round them, they never noticed that the swishing of the grasses grew louder and louder, and did not cease with the lapse of the breeze. A hand dropped abrupt as iron on Rachel\u2019s shoulder; it might have been a bolt from heaven. She fell beneath it, and the grass whipped across her eyes and filled her mouth and ears.", "Rachel, though robbed of her audience, had gone on playing to herself. From John Peel she passed to Bach, who was at this time the subject of her intense enthusiasm, and one by one some of the younger dancers came in from the garden and sat upon the deserted gilt chairs round the piano, the room being now so clear that they turned out the lights. As they sat and listened, their nerves were quieted; the heat and soreness of their lips, the result of incessant talking and laughing, was smoothed away. They sat very still as if they saw a building with spaces and columns succeeding each other rising in the empty space. Then they began to see themselves and their lives, and the whole of human life advancing very nobly under the direction of the music.", "She would not say of any one in the world now that they were this or were that. She felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged. She sliced like a knife through everything; at the same time was outside, looking on. She had a perpetual sense, as she watched the taxi cabs, of being out, out, far out to sea and alone; she always had the feeling that it was very, very dangerous to live even one day. Not that she thought herself clever, or much out of the ordinary.", "Surely then, if we ask this great master of the art of life to tell us his secret, he will advise us to withdraw to the inner room of our tower and there turn the pages of books, pursue fancy after fancy as they chase each other up the chimney, and leave the government of the world to others. Retirement and contemplation\u2014these must be the main elements of his prescription. But no; Montaigne is by no means explicit. It is impossible to extract a plain answer from that subtle, half smiling, half melancholy man, with the heavy-lidded eyes and the dreamy, quizzical expression.

But now mystery had brushed them with her wing; they had heard the voice of authority; the spirit of religion was abroad with her eyes bandaged tight and her lips gaping wide.

Are they ripe for rebellion, for example?", "When they woke next morning they had gone a considerable way up the river; on the right was a high yellow bank of sand tufted with trees, on the left a swamp quivering with long reeds and tall bamboos on the top of which, swaying slightly, perched vivid green and yellow birds. The morning was hot and still. After breakfast they drew chairs together and sat in an irregular semicircle in the bow. An awning above their heads protected them from the heat of the sun, and the breeze which the boat made aired them softly. Mrs. Flushing was already dotting and striping her canvas, her head jerking this way and that with the action of a bird nervously picking up grain; the others had books or pieces of paper or embroidery on their knees, at which they looked fitfully and again looked at the river ahead.", "In 1652, when it seemed that things had settled down unhappily enough, \"all being entirely in the rebels' hands\", Evelyn returned to England with his wife, his Tables of Veins and Arteries, his Venetian glass and the rest of his curiosities, to lead the life of a country gentleman of strong Royalist sympathies at Deptford. What with going to church and going to town, settling his accounts and planting his garden\u2014\"I planted the orchard at Sayes Court; new moon, wind west\"\u2014his time was spent much as ours is. But there was one difference which it is difficult to illustrate by a single quotation, because the evidence is scattered all about in little insignificant phrases. The general effect of them is that he used his eyes. The visible world was always close to him.", "While the storm continued, no one seemed inclined to sit down, but they collected in little groups under the central skylight, where they stood in a yellow atmosphere, looking upwards. Now and again their faces became white, as the lightning flashed, and finally a terrific crash came, making the panes of the skylight lift at the joints.", "The great fame of the book has done its author some injustice; for while it has given him a kind of anonymous glory it has obscured the fact that he was a writer of other works which, it is safe to assert, were not read aloud to us as children. Thus when the Editor of the Christian World in the year 1870 appealed to \"the boys and girls of England\" to erect a monument upon the grave of Defoe, which a stroke of lightning had mutilated, the marble was inscribed to the memory of the author of Robinson Crusoe. No mention was made of Moll Flanders. Considering the topics which are dealt with in that book, and in Roxana, Captain Singleton, Colonel Jack and the rest, we need not be surprised, though we may be indignant, at the omission. We may agree with Mr. Wright, the biographer of Defoe, that these \"are not works for the drawing-room table\".", "\u201cI was educated at Winchester and Cambridge, which I had to leave after a time.

The big slashing manuscripts of hockey-playing young women in Wiltshire lay on Arthur\u2019s knee, while Susan deciphered tight little legal hands which rarely filled more than a page, and always conveyed the same impression of jocular and breezy goodwill.", "Richard twisted a muffler twice round his throat and struggled up on deck. His body, which had grown white and tender in a dark room, tingled all over in the fresh air. He felt himself a man undoubtedly in the prime of life. Pride glowed in his eye as he let the wind buffet him and stood firm. With his head slightly lowered he sheered round corners, strode uphill, and met the blast.", "\u201cThank you, Hughling\u2019s better,\u201d she replied, in answer to Mrs. Thornbury\u2019s enquiry, \u201cbut he\u2019s not an easy patient. He wants to know what his temperature is, and if I tell him he gets anxious, and if I don\u2019t tell him he suspects. You know what men are when they\u2019re ill!

For how late it was getting! And, she murmured, as the night grew later, as people went, one found old friends; quiet nooks and corners; and the loveliest views.

Lights and trees and wonderful gleaming lakes and the sky.", "\u201cMiss Vinrace has promised to lunch with me,\u201d said Mrs. Flushing, and began to pound energetically up the staircase, as though the middle classes of England were in pursuit.

There they stand, in the British Museum, volume after volume, swarming with a diffused, uneasy, contorted vitality.", "In his temperate and reasonable way Addison more than once amused himself with speculations as to the fate of his writings. He had a just idea of their nature and value. \"I have new-pointed all the batteries of ridicule\", he wrote. Yet, because so many of his darts had been directed against ephemeral follies, \"absurd fashions, ridiculous customs, and affected forms of speech\", the time would come, in a hundred years, perhaps, when his essays, he thought, would be \"like so many pieces of old plate, where the weight will be regarded, but the fashion lost\". Two hundred years have passed; the plate is worn smooth; the pattern almost rubbed out; but the metal is pure silver.", "Such being her disposition it went hard with her to analyse the sparrow's crop, for the sparrow she felt, symbolises something of the homely virtue of English domestic life, and to proclaim it stuffed with deceit was disloyal to much that she, and her fathers before her, held dear. Sure enough the clergy\u2014the Rev. J. E. Walker\u2014denounced her for her brutality; \"God Save the Sparrow!\" exclaimed the Animal's Friend; and Miss Carrington, of the Humanitarian League, replied in a leaflet described by Miss Ormerod as \"spirity, discourteous, and inaccurate.\"", "\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll marry one of them,\u201d she said, and then turned the handle and shut the door behind her. She walked slowly down the passage, running her hand along the wall beside her.

She looked down at the kitchen premises, the wrong side of the hotel life, which was cut off from the right side by a maze of small bushes. The ground was bare, old tins were scattered about, and the bushes wore towels and aprons upon their heads to dry.", "\u201cAh,\u201d said Rezia, trying to remember.

Then she shuddered, and then she made the awkward angular movement that I had seen before, as if, after the spasm, some spot between the shoulders burnt or itched. Then again she looked the most unhappy woman in the world, and I once more reproached her, though not with the same conviction, for if there were a reason, and if I knew the reason, the stigma was removed from life.", "The next movement was on his part.

Heavy, ugly, commonplace, without kindness or grace, she know the meaning of life!", "\"It must have been written by a woman,\" one of us urged. But no. She told us that it was written by a young man, one of the most famous poets of the day. I leave you to imagine what the shock of the discovery was. Though we all cried and begged her to read no more, she persisted and read us extracts from the Lives of the Lord Chancellors.", "So the diners out stepped forward with long slips of paper containing answers to their questions. These had been framed after much consideration. A good man, we had agreed, must at any rate be honest, passionate, and unworldly. But whether or not a particular man possessed those qualities could only be discovered by asking questions, often beginning at a remote distance from the centre. Is Kensington a nice place to live in?", "\u201cHow heavenly it is to see you again!\u201d she exclaimed. He had his knife out. That\u2019s so like him, she thought.", "She had had to buy the roses, Rezia said, from a poor man in the street. But they were almost dead already, she said, arranging the roses.", "During this speech Susan came into the group, and sat down by Helen\u2019s side. A few minutes later Mr. Venning strolled up from the opposite direction. He was a little flushed, and in the mood to answer hilariously whatever was said to him.", "Indeed, Clarissa felt, the Prime Minister had been good to come. And, walking down the room with him, with Sally there and Peter there and Richard very pleased, with all those people rather inclined, perhaps, to envy, she had felt that intoxication of the moment, that dilatation of the nerves of the heart itself till it seemed to quiver, steeped, upright;\u2014yes, but after all it was what other people felt, that; for, though she loved it and felt it tingle and sting, still these semblances, these triumphs (dear old Peter, for example, thinking her so brilliant), had a hollowness; at arm\u2019s length they were, not in the heart; and it might be that she was growing old but they satisfied her no longer as they used; and suddenly, as she saw the Prime Minister go down the stairs, the gilt rim of the Sir Joshua picture of the little girl with a muff brought back Kilman with a rush; Kilman her enemy. That was satisfying; that was real. Ah, how she hated her\u2014hot, hypocritical, corrupt; with all that power; Elizabeth\u2019s seducer; the woman who had crept in to steal and defile (Richard would say, What nonsense!). She hated her: she loved her.", "Mr. Flushing treated his wife with a mixture of admiration and indulgence, making up by the suavity and fluency of his speech for the abruptness of hers. While she darted and ejaculated he gave Rachel a sketch of the history of South American art. He would deal with one of his wife\u2019s exclamations, and then return as smoothly as ever to his theme. He knew very well how to make a luncheon pass agreeably, without being dull or intimate. He had formed the opinion, so he told Rachel, that wonderful treasures lay hid in the depths of the land; the things Rachel had seen were merely trifles picked up in the course of one short journey.", "\u201cWell, and what\u2019s happened to you?\u201d she said. So before a battle begins, the horses paw the ground; toss their heads; the light shines on their flanks; their necks curve. So Peter Walsh and Clarissa, sitting side by side on the blue sofa, challenged each other. His powers chafed and tossed in him. He assembled from different quarters all sorts of things; praise; his career at Oxford; his marriage, which she knew nothing whatever about; how he had loved; and altogether done his job.", "There was still an hour to luncheon, and with Gibbon in one hand, and Balzac in the other she strolled out of the gate and down the little path of beaten mud between the olive trees on the slope of the hill. It was too hot for climbing hills, but along the valley there were trees and a grass path running by the river bed. In this land where the population was centred in the towns it was possible to lose sight of civilisation in a very short time, passing only an occasional farmhouse, where the women were handling red roots in the courtyard; or a little boy lying on his elbows on the hillside surrounded by a flock of black strong-smelling goats. Save for a thread of water at the bottom, the river was merely a deep channel of dry yellow stones. On the bank grew those trees which Helen had said it was worth the voyage out merely to see.", "\u201cDo you really believe there\u2019s life in Mars?\u201d asked Mrs. Flushing, turning to her for the first time with keen interest. \u201cWho tells you that? Some one who knows? D\u2019you know a man called\u2014?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not first-rate, of course; I\u2019m good second-rate; about as good as Thackeray, I should say.\u201d", "After a pause Hirst remarked that the worst infamy had still to be told. He addressed himself to Helen.", "She did not much like parties, Elizabeth said. Miss Kilman opened her mouth, slightly projected her chin, and swallowed down the last inches of the chocolate \u00e9clair, then wiped her fingers, and washed the tea round in her cup.", "Meanwhile Hirst took out an envelope and began scribbling on the back of it. When Mr. Bax mounted the pulpit he shut up Sappho with his envelope between the pages, settled his spectacles, and fixed his gaze intently upon the clergyman. Standing in the pulpit he looked very large and fat; the light coming through the greenish unstained window-glass made his face appear smooth and white like a very large egg.", "\u201cOh, I\u2019m entirely with you there,\u201d said Dalloway. \u201cNobody can condemn the utter folly and futility of such behaviour more than I do; and as for the whole agitation, well! may I be in my grave before a woman has the right to vote in England! That\u2019s all I say.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s high time that horses should become extinct anyhow,\u201d said Hirst. \u201cThey\u2019re distressingly ugly, besides being vicious.\u201d", "It was as though a blue shadow had fallen across a pool. Their eyes became deeper, and their voices more cordial. Instead of joining them as they began to pace the deck, Rachel was indignant with the prosperous matrons, who made her feel outside their world and motherless, and turning back, she left them abruptly. She slammed the door of her room, and pulled out her music. It was all old music\u2014Bach and Beethoven, Mozart and Purcell\u2014the pages yellow, the engraving rough to the finger.", "\"No, no, no,\" she said, shaking her head. \"If you'd been a chaste woman yourself you would have screamed at the sight of me\u2014instead of which you rushed across the room and took me in your arms. No, Cassandra. We are neither of us chaste.\" So we went on talking.", "She had once thrown a shilling into the Serpentine, never anything more. But he had flung it away. They went on living (she would have to go back; the rooms were still crowded; people kept on coming). They (all day she had been thinking of Bourton, of Peter, of Sally), they would grow old. A thing there was that mattered; a thing, wreathed about with chatter, defaced, obscured in her own life, let drop every day in corruption, lies, chatter.", "The little gush of vitality which had come into Evelyn as she ran downstairs had left her, and she felt herself impotent. There was nothing for her to say; she felt nothing. Now that he was actually asking her, in his elderly gentle words, to marry him, she felt less for him than she had ever felt before.", "\u201cI don\u2019t satisfy you in the way you satisfy me,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s something I can\u2019t get hold of in you. You don\u2019t want me as I want you\u2014you\u2019re always wanting something else.\u201d", "An imperceptible signal passed between husband and wife, meaning that they grasped the situation and would stand by each other loyally. With scarcely a pause Mrs. Dalloway turned to Willoughby and began:", "Lady Bruton stood by Miss Parry\u2019s chair, a spectral grenadier, draped in black, inviting Peter Walsh to lunch; cordial; but without small talk, remembering nothing whatever about the flora or fauna of India. She had been there, of course; had stayed with three Viceroys; thought some of the Indian civilians uncommonly fine fellows; but what a tragedy it was\u2014the state of India! The Prime Minister had just been telling her (old Miss Parry huddled up in her shawl, did not care what the Prime Minister had just been telling her), and Lady Bruton would like to have Peter Walsh\u2019s opinion, he being fresh from the centre, and she would get Sir Sampson to meet him, for really it prevented her from sleeping at night, the folly of it, the wickedness she might say, being a soldier\u2019s daughter. She was an old woman now, not good for much. But her house, her servants, her good friend Milly Brush\u2014did he remember her?\u2014were all there only asking to be used if\u2014if they could be of help, in short.", "\u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, Hirst,\u201d Hewet protested; \u201cone might think you were an old cripple of eighty. If it comes to that, I had an aunt who died of cancer myself, but I put a bold face on it\u2014\u201d He rose and began tilting his chair backwards and forwards on its hind legs. \u201cIs any one here inclined for a walk?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a magnificent walk, up behind the house. You come out on to a cliff and look right down into the sea.", "\u201cIf one can give men a room to themselves where they will sit, it\u2019s all to the good. Arm-chairs are the important things\u2014\u201d She began wheeling them about. \u201cNow, does it still look like a bar at a railway station?\u201d", "Let us take Persuasion, the last completed novel, and look by its light at the books she might have written had she lived. There is a peculiar beauty and a peculiar dullness in Persuasion. The dullness is that which so often marks the transition stage between two different periods. The writer is a little bored. She has grown too familiar with the ways of her world; she no longer notes them freshly.", "The matter being settled, they were once more put on shore: the sailors, producing raisins and tobacco, leant upon the rail and watched the six English, whose coats and dresses looked so strange upon the green, wander off. A joke that was by no means proper set them all laughing, and then they turned round and lay at their ease upon the deck.", "They would talk of such questions among books, or out in the sun, or sitting in the shade of a tree undisturbed. They were no longer embarrassed, or half-choked with meaning which could not express itself; they were not afraid of each other, or, like travellers down a twisting river, dazzled with sudden beauties when the corner is turned; the unexpected happened, but even the ordinary was lovable, and in many ways preferable to the ecstatic and mysterious, for it was refreshingly solid, and called out effort, and effort under such circumstances was not effort but delight.", "Left alone, Evelyn walked up and down the path. What did matter then? What was the meaning of it all?", "His eyes were dazed, his hands very cold, and his brain excited and yet half asleep. Inside the door everything was as he had left it except that the hall was now empty. There were the chairs turning in towards each other where people had sat talking, and the empty glasses on little tables, and the newspapers scattered on the floor. As he shut the door he felt as if he were enclosed in a square box, and instantly shrivelled up. It was all very bright and very small.", "\u201cAll one\u2019s faculties have their play,\u201d said Richard. \u201cI may be treading on dangerous ground; but what I feel about poets and artists in general is this: on your own lines, you can\u2019t be beaten\u2014granted; but off your own lines\u2014puff\u2014one has to make allowances. Now, I shouldn\u2019t like to think that any one had to make allowances for me.\u201d", "\u201cGood Lord, what opportunities there are now for young men!\u201d said Dalloway, for his talk had set him thinking. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s been so good an opening since the days of Pitt.\u201d", "\u201cAnd in that I quite agree with her,\u201d said a voice behind; Mrs. Thornbury had overheard the last few words about not liking ginger. \u201cIt\u2019s associated in my mind with a horrid old aunt of ours (poor thing, she suffered dreadfully, so it isn\u2019t fair to call her horrid) who used to give it to us when we were small, and we never had the courage to tell her we didn\u2019t like it. We just had to put it out in the shrubbery\u2014she had a big house near Bath.\u201d", "The skirt was fastened. She looked at herself in the glass with the curious stiffening of her face generally caused by looking in the glass.", "It was all too painful, and the guillotine, she felt, loomed ahead. That catastrophe she was spared, for who could wish to cut off the head of a pigeon with a whistle attached to its tail? But if the whole bird-cage had been overturned and the aerial orchestra sent screaming and fluttering through the air, we can be sure, as Mr. Joseph Chamberlain told her, that her conduct would have been \"a credit to the British aristocracy\".", "\u201cOne can be very nice without having read a book,\u201d she asserted. Very silly and simple her words sounded, and laid her open to derision.", "Oh, he did, she cried. But he did not mean it, she said. Of course not. It was merely a question of rest, said Sir William; of rest, rest, rest; a long rest in bed. There was a delightful home down in the country where her husband would be perfectly looked after.", "But will one crocus be enough, and must it not be a very brilliant yellow to shine so far, to cost so much, and to have one's name attached to it? The Press is undoubtedly a great multiplier of crocuses. But if we look at some of these plants, we shall find that they are only very distantly related to the original little yellow or purple flower which pokes up through the grass in Kensington Gardens about this time of year. The newspaper crocus is amazing but still a very different plant. It fills precisely the space allotted to it.", "\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d she asked him. For Willie Titcomb and Sir Harry and Herbert Ainsty were all laughing. But no. Sir Harry could not tell Clarissa Dalloway (much though he liked her; of her type he thought her perfect, and threatened to paint her) his stories of the music hall stage. He chaffed her about her party.", "\u201cThat\u2019s for Miss Vinrace,\u201d said Clarissa. \u201cShe can\u2019t bear our beloved Jane.\u201d", "Clarissa opened one eye. It gave her an incredibly dissipated appearance. \u201cAwful!\u201d she gasped. Her lips were white inside.", "He was slightly annoyed, and in his capacity as leader of the expedition, inclined to be dictatorial. He spoke quickly, using curiously sharp, meaningless words.", "It was so hot that they scarcely moved, except now to change a foot, or, again, to strike a match. Their eyes, concentrated upon the bank, were full of the same green reflections, and their lips were slightly pressed together as though the sights they were passing gave rise to thoughts, save that Hirst\u2019s lips moved intermittently as half consciously he sought rhymes for God. Whatever the thoughts of the others, no one said anything for a considerable space. They had grown so accustomed to the wall of trees on either side that they looked up with a start when the light suddenly widened out and the trees came to an end.", "\u201cHow are you, dear,\u201d said Mr. Ambrose, inclining his forehead to be kissed. His niece instinctively liked his thin angular body, and the big head with its sweeping features, and the acute, innocent eyes.", "They all smiled. Peter Walsh! And Mr. Dalloway was genuinely glad, Milly Brush thought; and Mr. Whitbread thought only of his chicken.", "\u201cClarissa!\u201d That voice! It was Sally Seton! Sally Seton! after all these years! She loomed through a mist.", "I understand Nature's game\u2014her prompting to take action as a way of ending any thought that threatens to excite or to pain. Hence, I suppose, comes our slight contempt for men of action\u2014men, we assume, who don't think. Still, there's no harm in putting a full stop to one's disagreeable thoughts by looking at a mark on the wall.", "After all, then, we are back at the beginning, vacillating from extreme to extreme, at one moment enthusiastic, at the next pessimistic, unable to come to any conclusion about our contemporaries. We have asked the critics to help us, but they have deprecated the task. Now, then, is the time to accept their advice and correct these extremes by consulting the masterpieces of the past. We feel ourselves indeed driven to them, impelled not by calm judgement but by some imperious need to anchor our instability upon their security. But, honestly, the shock of the comparison between past and present is at first disconcerting.", "\u201cWe love each other,\u201d Terence repeated, searching into her face. Their faces were both very pale and quiet, and they said nothing. He was afraid to kiss her again. By degrees she drew close to him, and rested against him. In this position they sat for some time.", "\u201cI\u2019ve cared for heaps of people, but not to marry them,\u201d she said. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m too fastidious. All my life I\u2019ve wanted somebody I could look up to, somebody great and big and splendid. Most men are so small.\u201d", "For her father had been looking at her, as he stood talking to the Bradshaws, and he had thought to himself, Who is that lovely girl? And suddenly he realised that it was his Elizabeth, and he had not recognised her, she looked so lovely in her pink frock! Elizabeth had felt him looking at her as she talked to Willie Titcomb. So she went to him and they stood together, now that the party was almost over, looking at the people going, and the rooms getting emptier and emptier, with things scattered on the floor. Even Ellie Henderson was going, nearly last of all, though no one had spoken to her, but she had wanted to see everything, to tell Edith.", "He looked curiously at his own hand on the banisters. The stairs were very steep, and it seemed to take him a long time to surmount them. Instead of feeling keenly, as he knew that he ought to feel, he felt nothing at all. When he opened the door he saw Helen sitting by the bedside. There were shaded lights on the table, and the room, though it seemed to be full of a great many things, was very tidy.", "\u201cThe odd thing is that I don\u2019t find you old at all,\u201d he replied. \u201cI feel as though we were exactly the same age. Moreover\u2014\u201d here he hesitated, but took courage from a glance at her face, \u201cI feel as if I could talk quite plainly to you as one does to a man\u2014about the relations between the sexes, about . . .", "\u201cTake it away! Give it to Mrs. Walker with my compliments! Take it away!\u201d she cried.", "Dr. Holmes came again. Large, fresh coloured, handsome, flicking his boots, looking in the glass, he brushed it all aside\u2014headaches, sleeplessness, fears, dreams\u2014nerve symptoms and nothing more, he said. If Dr. Holmes found himself even half a pound below eleven stone six, he asked his wife for another plate of porridge at breakfast. (Rezia would learn to cook porridge.) But, he continued, health is largely a matter in our own control.", "Rachel was swinging the bottle by the neck. She was interested by Miss Allan to the point of forgetting the bottle.", "\u201cGood Lord!\u201d Hewet exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so much interested in my life.\u201d She then realised that while she had been thinking of Richmond, his eyes had never left her face. The knowledge of this excited her.", "Clarissa looked at Sir William, talking to Richard. He did not look like a boy\u2014not in the least like a boy. She had once gone with some one to ask his advice. He had been perfectly right; extremely sensible. But Heavens\u2014what a relief to get out to the street again!", "I have often thought of it as one of the most barbarous customs in the world, considering us as a civilised and a Christian country, that we deny the advantages of learning to women. We reproach the sex every day with folly and impertinence; which I am confident, had they the advantages of education equal to us, they would be guilty of less than ourselves.", "\u201cDear old fellow,\u201d said Arthur who, now that the first shock was over, was relaxing into an enormous sense of pleasure and contentment. \u201cWe must be very nice to him, Susan.\u201d", "\u201cWe shall see you at our party to-night?\u201d whereupon Lady Bruton resumed the magnificence which letter-writing had shattered. She might come; or she might not come. Clarissa had wonderful energy. Parties terrified Lady Bruton. But then, she was getting old.", "Clarissa always said that Lady Bruton did not like her. Indeed, Lady Bruton had the reputation of being more interested in politics than people; of talking like a man; of having had a finger in some notorious intrigue of the eighties, which was now beginning to be mentioned in memoirs. Certainly there was an alcove in her drawing-room, and a table in that alcove, and a photograph upon that table of General Sir Talbot Moore, now deceased, who had written there (one evening in the eighties) in Lady Bruton\u2019s presence, with her cognisance, perhaps advice, a telegram ordering the British troops to advance upon an historical occasion. (She kept the pen and told the story.) Thus, when she said in her offhand way \u201cHow\u2019s Clarissa?\u201d husbands had difficulty in persuading their wives and indeed, however devoted, were secretly doubtful themselves, of her interest in women who often got in their husbands\u2019 way, prevented them from accepting posts abroad, and had to be taken to the seaside in the middle of the session to recover from influenza.", "But inwardly there was a change. It seems at last as if the hard outer shell had served its purpose and something sensitive, appreciative, and pleasure-loving had formed within. At any rate Sir John, writing to his brother John at home, strayed sometimes from the business on hand to crack a joke, to send a piece of gossip, or to instruct him, knowingly and even subtly, upon the conduct of a love affair. Be \"as lowly to the mother as ye list, but to the maid not too lowly, nor that ye be too glad to speed, nor too sorry to fail. And I shall always be your herald both here, if she come hither, and at home, when I come home, which I hope hastily within XI.", "Happily the port was now brought in, the servants assembled; and Miss Ormerod, rising to her feet, gave the toast \"Her Blessed Majesty.\" She was extremely loyal, and moreover she liked nothing better than a glass of her father's old white port. She kept his pigtail, too, in a box.", "\u201cI hear there are dreadful accounts from England about the rats,\u201d she said. \u201cA sister-in-law, who lives at Norwich, tells me it has been quite unsafe to order poultry. The plague\u2014you see. It attacks the rats, and through them other creatures.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ll do our best to make you comfortable. And Ridley. We think it an honour to have charge of him.

You find this child grown, don\u2019t you?", "\u201cQuite,\u201d said Terence with decision. \u201cIt\u2019s just got to run its course.\u201d Whereupon Ridley heaved a deep sigh. He was genuinely sorry for every one, but at the same time he missed Helen considerably, and was a little aggrieved by the constant presence of the two young men.", "\u201cOh, I\u2019ve done two or three little daubs,\u201d said Mrs. Elliot, speaking rather louder than usual. \u201cBut it\u2019s so difficult after Oxfordshire, where there are so many trees. The light\u2019s so strong here. Some people admire it, I know, but I find it very fatiguing.\u201d", "Lady Bruton herself preferred Richard Dalloway, who arrived at the next moment. Indeed they met on the doorstep.", "Miss Kilman took another cup of tea. Elizabeth, with her oriental bearing, her inscrutable mystery, sat perfectly upright; no, she did not want anything more. She looked for her gloves\u2014her white gloves. They were under the table. Ah, but she must not go!", "What could I have said to these people? 'Tis certain that this office of humanity would have brought them into trouble. . . .", "\u201cI\u2019m not like Hirst,\u201d said Hewet, after a pause; he spoke meditatively; \u201cI don\u2019t see circles of chalk between people\u2019s feet. I sometimes wish I did. It seems to me so tremendously complicated and confused. One can\u2019t come to any decision at all; one\u2019s less and less capable of making judgments.

Over her shoulder Lucy reported how Miss Elizabeth looked quite lovely; she couldn\u2019t take her eyes off her; in her pink dress, wearing the necklace Mr. Dalloway had given her.

But Jenny was not going upstairs with all those people about.", "He beginneth not with obscure definitions, which must blur the margent with interpretations, and load the memory with doubtfulness: but he cometh to you with words set in delightful proportion, either accompanied with, or prepared for the well enchanting Skill of Music, and with a tale (forsooth) he cometh unto you, with a tale which holdeth children from play, and old men from the Chimney corner; and pretending no more, doth intend the winning of the mind from wickedness to virtue; even as the child is often brought to take most wholesome things by hiding them in such other as have a pleasant taste: which if one should begin to tell them the nature of the Alo\u00ebs or Rhubarbarum they should receive, would sooner take their physic at their ears than at their mouth, so is it in men (most of which are childish in the best things, till they be cradled in their graves) glad they will be to hear the tales of Hercules. . . .", "Nor, indeed, would we. For even if the pangs of outraged vanity, or the heat of moral wrath, urged us to improve away a world so full of spite, pettiness, and folly, the task is beyond our powers. People are like that\u2014the girl of fifteen knew it; the mature woman proves it. At this very moment some Lady Bertram finds it almost too trying to keep Pug from the flower beds; she sends Chapman to help Miss Fanny, a little late. The discrimination is so perfect, the satire so just that, consistent though it is, it almost escapes our notice.", "Nevertheless, they remained uncomfortably apart; drawn so close together, as she spoke, that there seemed no division between them, and the next moment separate and far away again. Feeling this painfully, she exclaimed, \u201cIt will be a fight.\u201d", "\u201cYou heard, Aunt Emma, that poor Miss Vinrace has died of the fever,\u201d Susan informed her gently. She could not speak of death loudly or even in her usual voice, so that Mrs. Paley did not catch a word. Arthur came to the rescue.", "\u201cOh, what fun!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat am I sitting on? Is this your room? How jolly!\u201d \u201cThere\u2014sit there,\u201d she commanded. Cowper slid once more.", "That elusive quality is indeed often made up of very different parts, which it needs a peculiar genius to bring together. The wit of Jane Austen has for partner the perfection of her taste. Her fool is a fool, her snob is a snob, because he departs from the model of sanity and sense which she has in mind, and conveys to us unmistakably even while she makes us laugh. Never did any novelist make more use of an impeccable sense of human values. It is against the disc of an unerring heart, an unfailing good taste, an almost stern morality, that she shows up those deviations from kindness, truth, and sincerity which are among the most delightful things in English literature.", "He told her how hard Perrott\u2019s life had been, and how absurdly devoted he was to Arthur himself. He went on to tell her about his mother, a widow lady, of strong character. In return Susan sketched the portraits of her own family\u2014Edith in particular, her youngest sister, whom she loved better than any one else, \u201cexcept you, Arthur. . .", "\u201cIt does seem possible!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthough I\u2019ve always thought it the most unlikely thing in the world\u2014I shall be in love with you all my life, and our marriage will be the most exciting thing that\u2019s ever been done! We\u2019ll never have a moment\u2019s peace\u2014\u201d He caught her in his arms as she passed him, and they fought for mastery, imagining a rock, and the sea heaving beneath them. At last she was thrown to the floor, where she lay gasping, and crying for mercy.", "\u201cBut I must look so queer!\u201d she cried, running over to the glass and looking first this side then that. Then she snatched it off again, for there was a tap at the door. Could it be Sir William Bradshaw? Had he sent already?", "\u201cYou monster!\u201d Clarissa exclaimed. \u201cI can only just forgive you. Tell me why?\u201d", "\u201cTerence says we must go to tea with Mrs. Thornbury because she\u2019s been so kind, but I don\u2019t see it; in fact, I\u2019d rather have my right hand sawn in pieces\u2014just imagine! the eyes of all those women!\u201d", "No, no, nothing is proved, nothing is known. And if I were to get up at this very moment and ascertain that the mark on the wall is really\u2014what shall we say?\u2014the head of a gigantic old nail, driven in two hundred years ago, which has now, owing to the patient attrition of many generations of housemaids, revealed its head above the coat of paint, and is taking its first view of modern life in the sight of a white-walled fire-lit room, what should I gain?\u2014Knowledge? Matter for further speculation? I can think sitting still as well as standing up. And what is knowledge?", "They were very much afraid of her father. He was a great dim force in the house, by means of which they held on to the great world which is represented every morning in the Times. But the real life of the house was something quite different from this. It went on independently of Mr. Vinrace, and tended to hide itself from him. He was good-humoured towards them, but contemptuous.", "\u201cAh, poor thing,\u201d said Mrs. Thornbury, \u201cthat\u2019s a long story. She had gone through dreadful sorrows. At one time I think she would have lost her senses if it hadn\u2019t been for her garden. The soil was very much against her\u2014a blessing in disguise; she had to be up at dawn\u2014out in all weathers. And then there are creatures that eat roses.", "\u201cwhen you\u2019re my age you\u2019ll see that the world is crammed with delightful things. I think young people make such a mistake about that\u2014not letting themselves be happy. I sometimes think that happiness is the only thing that counts. I don\u2019t know you well enough to say, but I should guess you might be a little inclined to\u2014when one\u2019s young and attractive\u2014I\u2019m going to say it!\u2014everything\u2019s at one\u2019s feet.\u201d She glanced round as much as to say, \u201cnot only a few stuffy books and Bach.\u201d", "For the self-centred and self-limited writers have a power denied the more catholic and broad-minded. Their impressions are close packed and strongly stamped between their narrow walls. Nothing issues from their minds which has not been marked with their own impress. They learn little from other writers, and what they adopt they cannot assimilate. Both Hardy and Charlotte Bront\u00eb appear to have founded their styles upon a stiff and decorous journalism.", "\u201cIt shortens one\u2019s life; but I\u2019m afraid, Mrs. Ambrose, we politicians must make up our minds to that at the outset. We\u2019ve got to burn the candle at both ends, or\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI tell you what I want to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to go up there and see things for myself. It\u2019s silly stayin\u2019 here with a pack of old maids as though we were at the seaside in England. I want to go up the river and see the natives in their camps. It\u2019s only a matter of ten days under canvas.", "\u201cD\u2019you know,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m extraordinarily sleepy. It\u2019s the sea air. I think I shall escape.\u201d", "London has swallowed up many millions of young men called Smith; thought nothing of fantastic Christian names like Septimus with which their parents have thought to distinguish them. Lodging off the Euston Road, there were experiences, again experiences, such as change a face in two years from a pink innocent oval to a face lean, contracted, hostile. But of all this what could the most observant of friends have said except what a gardener says when he opens the conservatory door in the morning and finds a new blossom on his plant:\u2014It has flowered; flowered from vanity, ambition, idealism, passion, loneliness, courage, laziness, the usual seeds, which all muddled up (in a room off the Euston Road), made him shy, and stammering, made him anxious to improve himself, made him fall in love with Miss Isabel Pole, lecturing in the Waterloo Road upon Shakespeare.", "There remains the greatest of all novelists\u2014for what else can we call the author of War and Peace? Shall we find Tolstoi, too, alien, difficult, a foreigner? Is there some oddity in his angle of vision which, at any rate until we have become disciples and so lost our bearings, keeps us at arm's length in suspicion and bewilderment? From his first words we can be sure of one thing at any rate\u2014here is a man who sees what we see, who proceeds, too, as we are accustomed to proceed, not from the inside outwards, but from the outside inwards. Here is a world in which the postman's knock is heard at eight o'clock, and people go to bed between ten and eleven.", "She did not move. \u201cTell me the truth, tell me the truth,\u201d he kept on saying. He felt as if his forehead would burst. She seemed contracted, petrified. She did not move."]}
